Issue disappears after
	- Removing `sdblock2mem_wishbonedmawriter_sink_ready` from the if-statement (line 2422)
	- Removing `sdblock2mem_wishbonedmawriter_sink_ready` from the assignemnt (line 2413)
	- Removing `sdblock2mem_wishbonedmawriter_sink_ready` from the assignemnt (line 2439)

Signal `sdblock2mem_wishbonedmawriter_sink_ready`...
	- is a register (line 684)
	- is assigned to `sdblock2mem_source_source_ready` (a wire) (line 2351)
	- participates a the state machine (line 2404)

Signal `sdblock2mem_source_source_ready`...
	- is a wire (line 674)
	- is assigned by `sdblock2mem_wishbonedmawriter_sink_ready` (line 2351)
	- is assigned to `sdblock2mem_converter_source_ready` (a wire) (line 2386)

----

This problem manifests when two things happen:
	- The `sdblock2mem_wishbonedmawriter_sink_ready` is assigned twice within the always @(*) block
	- Something inside the always @(*) depends on `sdblock2mem_wishbonedmawriter_sink_ready` (the if-statement)

Unsuccessfully attempted to reproduce with just this structure (using two new registers).

This is the closest I've come to seeing someone else hit this issue with Icarus Verilog.

----

Assigning to `sdblock2mem_wishbonedmawriter_sink_ready` exactly once in each path fixes the issue.
